## About the Generator

The purpose of this project is to create a simple project using html, a miniscule amount of CSS, and primarily Javscript to create a password generator. This will allow a user to choose a criterium (with limits) that will allow for a password to be generated including the following:

- Length ranging from 1 - 128
- Can include any combination of upper case and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.

Additionally, another feature was added which will, upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, make a "Copy to Clipboard" button visible. This will allow the entire textfield housing the generated password to be copied to the user's clipboard for pusposes such as saving for later use or entering the text elsewhere.
